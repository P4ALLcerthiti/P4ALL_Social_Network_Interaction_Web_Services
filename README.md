# P4A - Social Network Interaction (Web Services)      

P4A Social Network Interaction is a module for clustering large number of social networks’ data based on their common features. By encoding the 
activities of the entities within the network as multi-modal and/or multi-parametric objects (the object-user may 
have many attributes), and by modelling the social network data into k-partite graphs we manage to efficiently
 categorize the entities into certain behavioral groups – provided that the positioning of the objects over the 
 graph is based on the relevance of their attributes.



# Dependencies  

The following libraries are necessary for the execution of Social Network Interaction module. Older subversions may also be compatible:  

1. [Qt 5.5.1] (http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/) : Used to build the sample App.        

2. [Tweepy] (http://www.tweepy.org/) : Used to access the Twitter API.   

3. [C++ REST SDK] (https://casablanca.codeplex.com/) : Used to build the RESTful Web Services.
